GENERAL:

- don't use GTree.  libavl?

NOW:

- Better name for "WaveTable"?

SYNTH:

- remove function calls where appropriate (machines should be fast)

- use floats internally?

- looped samples.  check out timidity-patches

- GUS .pat-reader

- Pitchbend

- Vibrato

- Effects.  Reverb?  Filter?  Look at sox, Sonic Flow, DAP, mxv...
  SoundTracker and the XM format

- Envelope

- Aftertouch

ADDITIVE SYNTH:

- You should be able to graphically set up frequency composition at
certain envelope points, and then it "morphs" linearly between these.
GUI code from AUBE?  What's SoundTracker got?

AUDIO:

- generalize audio. use some library?

- really make sure OSS is used correctly (check return values etc.)

- only have device open when needed?

- let user choose output form (sampling rate, format...) 

- does it take proper care of endianness?

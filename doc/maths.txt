The function `wavegen_note_do_stuff'
------------------------------------

One period is 2.0 * PI.

`freq' is the base frequency for the note (e.g. 440 for A4)

`amplitude' is the amplitude for the note (0 to 32767)

`angle' is where we are on the circle right now (0.0 to 2.0 * PI)

`sample_rate' is the number of samples per second (e.g. 44100)

`samples_per_wave' is the number of samples per wave.  It is calculated
as sample_rate / freq. 

`inc_angle' is how much `angle' should be increased with for every sample.
It is calculated as:

(1.0 / samples_per_wave) * (2.0*PI)  ==
(2.0*PI) / samples_per_wave ==
(2.0*PI) / (sample_rate / freq) 

LFO ("vibrato")
---------------

These parameters are needed:

- amplitude
- frequency

We want these parameters directly MIDI controllable (at least amplitude).

(I can't find any standard MIDI controller message for this??)

Pitchbend
---------

MIDI pitch wheel values are between 0 and 0x3FFF, 0x2000 is a centered
pitch wheel (unmodified value). 

There should be an instrument setting `max_pitchbend' that determines 
how many half-notes up the max value (0x3FFF) corresponds to.  The min
value (0) will then correspond to the same number of half-notes down.

The default should probably be 12, one octave.  I.e., a pitchbend value
of 0x3FFF doubles the pitch and a value of 0 "halves" it.

Look at the procedure `pitchbend' in maths.sml for an example
implementation.

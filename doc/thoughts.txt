1. Configuration

`machines' will be configuraable in two ways:

	1. setup through Guile

	2. runtime configuration through MIDI

1.1 Setup through Guile
----------------------

Here you can set up instruments, wavetables, MIDI channels,
etc. exactly as you want through Guile code.

But: Why does guile take two years to start? 

1.2. Setup through MIDI
---------------------

The only way for `machines' to communicate with other programs at
runtime is through MIDI, with specialized control through control and
SysEx messages.  So the configurator program needs to have contact
with `machines' at the same time as e.g. midikb is used for input.

This would best be done by some kind of midi server.  midid.

An alternative would be to let `machines' do input/output through
several streams (FIFOs). 

Anyway, in some way, contact is made.  Now SysEx messages can be sent,
back and forth.  These include commands such as:

- Get or modify channel settings
- Get or modify instrument settings

Also control messages such as:

- Change vibrato
- Cutoff, resonance, bla bla
